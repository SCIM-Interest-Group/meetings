# Notes
 * Nancy Cam Winget is one of the BoF Chairs
 * Questions are more likely in the Body of Work and Charter sections
 * Recommendation: spend the bulk of the time in the body of work
     * This will help us tweak the charter
 * Nancy raising a flag to note that there is raised sensitivity to privacy currently, so we need to be especially aware in some of our charter items, and this could lead to extra scrutiny especially in the area of the HR schema (for obvious reasons)
     * It is worth taking extra time to assuage concerns in advance and to be very aware of industry advances

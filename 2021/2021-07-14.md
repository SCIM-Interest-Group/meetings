# SCIM IG Interim Meeting 14 July 2021

Attending:
 * Barry Leiba
* Morteza Ansari 
* Nancy Cam Winget
* Phil Hunt
* Matt Peterson
* Roman Danyliw

# Goals
1) What is the MVP we want out of the BoF
2) Questions around the charter
3) Action items for who has what with schedule
4) Comms channels
* do what we can via email
* schedule one more meeting to make sure we're aligned

# What to expect
 * SCIM is niche
    * need to respect and accommodate interested folks who drop in, but that volume is unlikely to result in participants

 * Is Standards Tracking the existing spec an option?
    * Today the RFCs are "proposed"
    * To make them internet standards, need to prove experience, find gaps 
    * Moving to an IS is just an IETF process, no difference to what the WG produces

# Charter Review
 * Question: Changes to core?

# Session Planning
 * Nancy and Barry will be at the front of the room as the official BoF co-chairs
     * Morteza also!
 * At the end the chairs will take the temperature of the room
    * Do we understand
    * Are we willing to review
 * No going over in time!
 * Success: rallying the community, active participation
 * Need a pre-amble to explain the continuation
* Format:  Problem-Solution-Approach
    * Why are we even having this conversation?
    * What could the solution be?
    * Here is the charter, can we arm wrestle

# Agenda
 * Paul/Matt P go through SCIM-PAM draft
 * Matt D to go through the actions from previous group surveys (a spreadsheet we are calling the SCIM IG Interest List)

# SCIM PAM ietf draft Summary
 * Paul/Matt note that they are not original authors and hope they do justice to the original draft spec, with apologies and thanks to Kelly Grizzle, et al
     * Spec link:  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-grizzle-scim-pam-ext-01
     * Spec Github page: https://github.com/kelly-grizzle-sp/scim-pam
     * Presentation link:  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qd6pewmf_DXVydtg9siHeQvC5xhnJ4OmqEQcJzoyf9E/edit#slide=id.gc83ee66d31_0_265
 * Usage: SCIM PAM is in active use in the SCIM PAM Sailpoint connector
     * Lots of SailPoint customers are using it already
 * Purpose: The draft helps IGA+PAM solutions to do two things together:
     * use SCIM to read Privileged Data
     * Use SCIM to read and modify the access rights to Privileged Data (ACLs)

* Paper Cuts
    * The draft needs a statement of purpose.  The draft does 2 things but nobody ever summarizes those things
    * Reading/writing ACLs is done in a very specific way - opportunity for us as a group is to make this a more generalized standardized SCIM-esque standard
        * Because there is no authorization in SCIM the draft had to build that functionality
            * We have the opportunity to build that into SCIM core which would make this draft much more concise
    * There is no SCIM concept of linking objects.
        * We have the opportunity to make that pattern more standardized 
        * Linked objects is a generically useful concept that we could make easy
        * A way to canonically address the authority
            * Need some kind of way to designate who the canonical authority is for an attribute
    * Difficult to determine when something has changed in SCIM   
        * Notifications are a problem
            * Matt D would love to see a webhook-style change mechanism

## SCIM 2021 Interest List
* Matt overviewed the items in the list - a combination of existing drafts (including the SCIM-PAM draft we just reviewed today) and also additional ideas
    * The tentative plan is
        * Matt to get the list into a format that we can collectively iterate on
        * We will make topics out of all the items in this meeting

## Persistent Questions for Future Meetings (or to go to the group)
    * Is multi-value pagination a special case for groups only or a more generic concern?
    * Do we need to address only object pagination or is cursor pagination as important?
    
## Next Meeting: 
* April 21, 3pm PT
    * Pam to ask Mark Wahl if he will summarize his draft
    * More work on the Interest List
    * Pam to get the plan for sorting videos figured out

## Notes

### Soft Delete - Review led by Jeremy Palanchar
* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ansari-scim-soft-delete-00
* 
* In an Enterprise scenario, there could be cases where a user joins the organization, gains some entitilements, may take actions that generate audit logs, or take actions that end up with objects referring to them
* Should that user leave the organization, the org may choose to retain the user object in order to maintain existing links or references - this is one use case for soft delete.
* In this case, the IDP could request to delete the user but the target application may say no
* This can cause issues for example with identifier recycling
    * eg a new John Smith gets hired but a pre-existing John Smith was soft deleted
* Question:  why would the service not just disable the user rather than soft deleting it?
    * The org may not want to manage the user, or there could be licensing implications.  The org may explicitly *want* to reuse jsmith as a userID.   These are some reasons to delete rather than disable
    * Or in a retail environment with 80% turnover, you could end up with many many ghost users in the system, and in that case it would be very valuable to try to clean up the directory
    * Examples of services that don't like to hard-delete are Salesforce and Workplace by Facebook
* The current draft is a case where the client says delete, the server says ok, but then soft-deletes and hides the user from future queries unless a specific query string is sent.  
    * The draft also talks about what an undelete might look like
    * Also, there is an idea of what a direct request for hard delete could look like
    * The real trickery is making sure the SCIM server can not only soft delete but also eliminate conflicts with incoming active users and soft deleted users
        * A soft delete followed by a user create of the same userid should be all handled on the server side (today this has to be done on the client side)
* Comment from Danny
    * We did not allow ids to be reused on the fly - soft delete just hid the user id server side
    * People who rejoin the company would get back their own id
* Jeremy noted that both paradigms are common in today's Enterprise
* Question - is this just combining an immutable ID with a user-facing identifier, keeping the former the same and changing the latter?
    * Jeremy: yes that is what we did, but we had to do it as a bespoke implementation.
    * It could be that every SCIM server does that work as a bespoke implementation, it's just the interaction behavior that needs to be consistent
* Question:   how does the draft handle undelete:
    * Jeremy:  the draft says there is a query string parameter that prompts a state change representing a user
        * But if a client makes a create request and the external identity exists as a soft-deleted object at the server, the server should consider that an undelete 

* Question : if you require an undelete but the server is unwilling to perform, how can that be encoded?
    * Client could make a request that causes internal corruption or other problems
    * Server needs ability to say "no thank you"

* having implemented several clients that need soft delete, it is more complex on the client side because different servers require different attributes to be unique, which affects ability to soft delete. 
    * For example in WP4FB email and externalid all need to be changed plus knowing which attribute is needed to disable, may need to remove from groups, may need to modify manager relationship, which is a lot to remember.  If this was done on the server, this complexity would be taken care of.
* Question: does the server need to know about all the needs of the client?  (compared to the opposite above)
    * Context is that this occurs when a client wants to delete and the server doesn't allow it.  The client is making CREATE/DELETE requests and driving the "boat" in this case.   The draft tries to address the specific situation where a client tries to execute a DELETE and the server is unwilling to perform the operation.  This leaves the client stuck, looking to reclaim identifiers, licenses, and clean up but the server refuses to let go
    * If the client never has to delete the user, this is less useful, but the conflict happens when the client wants one thing and the server can't fulfill

* Question: is there an issue around cascading soft delete (ie )
    * There is a scenario where there are knock on effects within the system such as keeping referential pointers in line
    * Doesn't sound like this is a common issue now - but could be a consideration
    * Only a very sophisticated client would want to know the difference between soft/hard deletes anyway, in theory the behavior is the same when a CREATE is called - but a "v2" client would only really know that the user doesn't show up in queries
* Question: is there anyone else out there who thinks there is a difficult solution to this problem?
    * It is possible that some clients might think altering records would work rather than deleting
* Question; would it be useful to try to communicate the set of requirements needed for a client to successfully remove identifiers?

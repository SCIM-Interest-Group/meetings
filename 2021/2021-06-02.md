# Notes
 * these meetings ARE under the terms of "Note Well"
     * if what you are saying is proprietary you are required to disclose it
     * more info on Note Well: https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well/

* What is a BOF anyway
    * Demonstration to Area Director and IETF mgmt that there is a reason and that there are adults in the room
* On the paging draft
    * there are cool new features in the paging draft such as selecting subsets of multi-valued attributes
    * you could have millions of values in a JSON doc, for example a large group
    * Ideally the goal would be to minimize the return
    * EG: entitlements, where you are searching for a 2ndary attribute
* Phil:  SCIM was created as a provisioning protocol, not a directory and as such, User Interfaces were out of scope - but people do it all the time
    * Question to group: Should that SCOPE change?
        * Resource sub-selection could be very interesting
        * Possibly a standardized picker?
    * Matt Peterson: sent an email to the list around possibilities in pagination 
        * Discussion here: https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/scim/nNSN8NXBOPDS-8bw05N2J46FTT0/
* Phil: possible best practices document: mapping best practices for writing robust RESTful SCIM client code
    * eg: client tries to assert long id, server forces simple
    * what to do?
* Topic:  sub-attributes (metadata for attributes)
    * Date created, last modified etc
    * Kevin: Possible angle around signed attributes/blockchain?
    * Possible future debate??
* Phil:  HTTP Conditionals 
    * header containing if statements (so matching can occur) - only load the document if the match succeeds (RFC 7232)
    * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Conditional_requests

* Points on the Interest List
    * Triggers and Events
        * Pam: are there better places? 
        * Matt:  issue is around client-side caching - customers want it
            * Phil: this is a prime use case for conditionals but it is a polling solution unfortunately
        * Tim: in the development of SSE, an effort was made to be an "in-session" framework rather than a way to push SCIM data
        * Matt: there are already frameworks where a changed event emits notifications (that way they are idempotent)
* Talking about the List in Order:
    * Multi-value Filtering/Paging
        * Matt: Why were entitlements never a first-class resource?  
* Interest:
    * Multi-value filter/paging: check
    * Cursor pagination (*):  could be smaller support
        * folks in original group had concerns over DOS potential
        * from client perspective, need a way to sync the data
    * Relying Party User Provisioning:  check
    * Soft Delete:  check
    * PAM Schema (*):  
        * concepts outdated, draft needs to be revisited
        * value in idea but 
    * New HR Schema (new)(*)
        * 
    * Schema Work
        * HR
        * Research & Education
        * Enterprise "Group" Schema
            * Today group doesn't have schema
            *
